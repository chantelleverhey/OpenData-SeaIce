README

This repository was created as an exercise for the 5803 Geomatics class at Carleton University. The following demostrates the intended outcomes of the Tutorial.

Lawrence Hamilton, Uma Bhatt, Edward Blanchard-Wrigglesworth, Mitchell Bushuk, Julienne Stroeve, Betsy Turner-Bogren, & Helen Wiggins. (2023). Sea Ice Outlook 2008-2023, Pan-arctic region. Arctic Data Center. doi:10.18739/A2WS8HN79.

## Learning objectives 
- Demonstrate the practicalities of open data (Walking through applying and assessing FAIR principles)
- Reuse of open sea-ice data extent found through federated system
- Reference notes of Schema.org application in Research Data Management (use of controlled vocabulary for enhanced metadata interoperability)
- Assess the FAIRness of a dataset through the Arctic Data Centers FAIR report
- Explore open satellite data in polar tep through application of time series graphing
- Creating personal access token to push project to github 
- Impact of EO open data
- Basic understanding of Github and its uses
- Set-up and linked with PolarTEP

## Questions related to learning objectives
1) Where to find good open data?
2) How do you contribute open data in a way that adheres to the FAIR principles?
Why does interoperability matter for EO data? What can it feed into in regard to the larger research data management paradigm?


## Skills required of participant
- Basic understanding of computer systems and coding (Python)
https://pep8.org/ 
- Basic understanding and access to PolarTEP
- Access should already be completed due to PolarTEP workshop earlier in class (Students: please make sure you have access to your account)
- Basic understanding of FAIR principles
